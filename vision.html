vision:
  - question: "Why conversational DBMS?"
    answer: The general public does not know SQL and it is often difficult for a computer major to write an SQL query that accurately reflects their intentions. In fact, it is even difficult for users to check whether they have properly written SQL queries. We build a natural language interface to DBMS so that anyone can use DBMS with ease.
  - question: Development Plan
    answer: Over 8 years, we set three milestones to develop conversational self-tuning DBMS and release three different versions of the product. The first milestone is to set a cornerstone of the project by collecting the dataset and building the conversational interface. The second milestone is to improve system usability by adding query recommendations and data interpretation. The third milestone is to develop a self-tuning engine and complete the development of conversational self-tuning DBMS.
  - question: Why Self-tuning DBMS?
    answer: DBMS tuning is an important task that requires advanced knowledge of DBMS. Expert database administrators (DBAs) are mainly responsible for such task, but it is difficult for small companies or individuals to hire a DBA. We provide a self-tuning DBMS that can automatically tune its diverse configurations and maintain high performance in all situations.
  - question: Contribution to open source community
    answer: We believe there are many strong sides to open-sourcing our project to the public. We plan to manage open source projects along our development period and eventually register our project as an official Apache project.
